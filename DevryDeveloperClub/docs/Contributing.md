# Process of work

[Back](../../Readme.md)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to DeVry Developer's Club. It's people like you that make DeVry Developer's Club grow and provide more opportunity.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. Additionally, your requests, features, and additions are the contributions that will not only shape the site itself, but the DeVry Developer's Club as a whole!

All contributions are valuable to us, as this entire organization is built on learning and growing as developers. This includes learning how to contribute to open source projects. If you find a bug or see a feature we could benefit from make an issue or go ahead and write the pull request! Be noted that all additions will go through the Board Members and Primary Development Team, and may be declined from being included.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Keep smaller or more support related conversation to the #support channel on the Official Discord.

# Ground Rules

### Responsibilities

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Mobile, Tablet, and PC. Make sure to plan for Mobile first.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any functions to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using classes.
* Keep feature versions as minimal, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first!
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your Pull Request, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

* Testing is encouraged **Heavily** but we understand testing is alien to many of us.

All Features, Fixes, and Document changes need to be their own Fork or Branch. This is to ensure minimum site downtime.

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Create a Pull Request to be Reviewed and added to the main branch.

# How to report a bug

### Security Disclosure
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Message the Admin on the Offical Discord.

> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just message an Admin.

### How to file a bug report.

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

> 1. What version of dotnet are you using?
> 2. What editor are you using?
> 3. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 4. What did you do?
> 5. What did you expect to see?
> 6. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

### Roadmap & Goals

At the moment no Roadmap exists, but in time we will develop one.

Regardless of that, our primary goal for the DeVry Developer's Club website is to have a succinct place for other students to learn about us and what we stand for. Any Pull Requests or Suggestions regarding these goals will be given deeper consideration.


### Suggesting a Feature

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that we have today, were added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. We will look into it and give it consideration for if it truly is beneficial to add.

### Code Reviews
Everyone is expected to behave in a professional manner. No one is perfect. A code review is common practice in the software development
industry. Perhaps an industry standard wasn't followed (naming conventions for instance), or 
a more optimal approach exists, or a particular use case wasn't thought of.  

These reviews are meant to act not only as a learning experience to some but to ensure the code going into
production is the best possible version we can deploy.

All peer comments must be resolved.

### Release State
If all the above criteria are met and passing - if the issue you worked on is slated for the current release
it will get merged.

If your work is not slated for a future release it will be labeled as "Ready for Next Release". Once the current
release is cut - your PR will get merged.
